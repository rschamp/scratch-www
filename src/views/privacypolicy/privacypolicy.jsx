                                In order to build projects or comment on other users' projects,
                                 you need to make an account. During account creation, we ask you
                                 for a username, your country, birth month and year, gender, and
                                 your email address (or your parent or guardian's email address if
                                 you are under 13 years old). We ask that you select a user name
                                 that does not disclose your real name or other information that
                                 could identify you. Other users can see your username and country,

                                 on the Scratch servers. Other users can see your shared projects,
                                 comments, and forum posts, along with your username. Because the
                                 Scratch Team is responsible for moderation, we have access to all
                                 content stored on the Scratch website, including unshared projects.
                                 If you prefer to work on projects in complete privacy, you can use

                                When you use Scratch, our servers will automatically store a limited
                                 amount of information about how you use the website. This information
                                 includes a number that identifies your computer (the IP address), which
                                 pages you visited, and what browser you are using.

                                We also collect some data on where you click and which parts of the
                                 site you visit using Google Analytics. This "click data" helps us figure
                                 out ways to improve the website. Information collected and processed by
                                 Google Analytics includes the user's IP address, network location, and
                                 geographic location. Google Analytics acquires all its information
                                 directly from the user, by installing a cookie (see below) on your
                                 computer, if you have enabled JavaScript. Scratch does not share any
                                 information it collects with Google, and Google does not collect any
                                 personal identifying information about you.

                                When you log in, the Scratch website asks your browser to put an http
                                 "cookie" on your computer. The cookie is actually a small text file
                                 that our site can send to your browser for storage on your computer.
                                 This allows the website to remember that you are logged in when you
                                 go to a different page.
